#TODO:
 - make images not interactable as images (no dragging, no search for similar image, etc)
 - add border around images for spotlight
 - update spotlight as scroll dist increases
 - add text that appears as you scroll in and stays on screen (spotlight logic)
 - finally fix the box
 - add something to fill white space on first page (curved lines? see fireship video and "borrow" code)
